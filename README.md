# Summary-Docker

## Introduction
`Summary-Docker` is a personal journey into the depths of Docker. The project serves both as a learning tool and as a practical guide, evolving over time to cover core Docker topics and hands-on exercises. Whether you're new to Docker or revisiting concepts, this repo offers structured insights and real-world examples.

### ðŸ§  Documentation
1. [History](./src/docs/1-history.md): Learn the origins of Docker, how containers evolved, and the key initiatives that helped standardize container technology
2. [Theory](./src/docs/2-theory.md): Understand how Docker works under the hood â€” from container vs. VM differences to the engine, image layers, registries, and multi-architecture builds
3. [Containers](./src/docs/3-containers.md): Explore how containers run applications, manage processes, restart policies, and how to interact with them during runtime
4. [Docker Images](./src/docs/4-images.md): Master the image lifecycle: containerizing apps, building and pushing images, using Dockerfile keywords, and optimizing with multi-stage builds
5. [Docker Compose](./src/docs/5-compose.md): Discover how to define and run multi-container applications with Docker Compose using YAML configuration and essential commands
6. [Docker Swarm](./src/docs/6-swarm.md): Learn to build, configure, and scale a Swarm cluster with managers and workers, deploy services, ensure high availability, and manage rolling updates
7. [Docker Stack](./src/docs/7-stack.md): Deploy containerized applications declaratively on Docker Swarm using Stack files and Compose syntax â€” including networking and load balancing
8. [Network](./src/docs/8-network.md): Understand Dockerâ€™s networking model, including bridge and overlay networks, the CNM theory, and how Libnetwork and drivers enable container communication
