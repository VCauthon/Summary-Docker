# Defining a compose

The aim of this task is to create a compose file that unifies the services of the [previous] exercise (../3-webpage-communicates-with-redis/README.md).

In other words, these services should be unified in a single solution:
- webpage
- redis
- network

And, additionally, generate a volume with what is necessary to reflect the changes made in compose in a more agile way.

> __NOTE__: In this exercise, the same code from the previous exercise must be used, i.e., the compose itself must make reference to it.

# Solution

Raise the solution with the following command:

```bash
docker compose .
```

> __NOTE__: You have to be in the root folder of this readme to execute it
