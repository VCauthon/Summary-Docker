## Container-related standards and projects

There are several important standards and governance bodies influencing the development of containers and the container ecosystem. Some of these include:
### [__The OCI__](https://opencontainers.org/)

Governance council responsible for low-level container-related standards.

Some history about OCI:
- It operates from the Linux Foundation and was founded in the early days of the container ecosystem when some of the people at a company called CoreOS didn't like the way docker was dominating the ecosystem.
- In response, CoreOS created an open standard called [`appc`](https://github.com/appc/spec) that defined specifications for things such as image format and container runtime.
- The `appc` standard did things differently from Docker and put the ecosystem in an awkward position with two competing standards.
- Competition is usually a good thing, competing standards are generally bad, as they generate confusion that slows down user adoption.
- The main figures of `appc` then decided to came together and formed the OCI as a vendor-neutral lightweight council to govern containers standards.

At the time of the writing the OCI maintains three standards called specs:
- [The image-spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec): Creates and maintains the software shipping container image format spec
- [The runtime-spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec): Develops specifications for standards on Operating System process and application containers
- [The distribution-spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec): Defines an API protocol to facilitate and standardize the distribution of content
 
### [__The CNCF__](https://www.cncf.io/)

It was founded in 2015 with the goal of _"...advancing container technologies... and making cloud native computing ubiquitous"_. Instead of creating and maintaining container-related specifications, the CNCF host important project such as Kubernetes, containerd, Notary, Prometheus, Cilium, and lots more.

When we say the CNCF host these projects we mean it provides a space, structure, and support for projects to grow and mature. Fore example, all CNCF projects pass through the following three phases or stages:
- Sandbox: Gives support to new ideas and projects to
- Incubating: Gives the needed time to be production ready products
- Graduated: They are ready for production adn are guaranteed to have strong governance.

### [__The Moby Project__](https://mobyproject.org/)

Place for developers to build specialized tools for building container platforms.

Platform builders can pick the specific Moby tools they need to build their container platform. They can even compose their platforms from a mix of Moby tools, in-house tools, and tools from other projects.
